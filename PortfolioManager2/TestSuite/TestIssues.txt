Issues
======
Decide on whether Lookups are enums or classes or tables or interfaces

Account is public (even in Factory?)
Need to remove "new"
TransactionTypes are newable

Duplicate Accounts can be created  (same name, same details?)
how do we delete a transaction?
Reconciled Transactions need a Date
Adding a Transaction and Account Balance should be atomic?

Keeping ENUM and Enum Tables in sync

WTF is EF for?

Features
========
Open\Create Portfolio
Open Account
Add Transactions To Account
Recurring Transactions
Database Tie In

Refactor?
=========
Should we store the transactions against the account, or the account against the transactions?

Concept
=======
Does bank really need a collection of Accounts?  If we can only have 1 open, why do we need to link the accounts to it?
Is a transfer transaction, a special case or two transactions.
Statement
Does a transaction belong to a statement, or is a statement made up of transactions?
